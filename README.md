# Porous
---



Porous is a work in progress program that processes the [Big Graphene dataset](https://nrc-digital-repository.canada.ca/eng/view/object/?id=9f09901d-0736-4204-a35d-0c88ffb8da3b) which consists of DFT calculations of ground state energy for around 500,000 samples of graphene with random pores, made for training an [Extensive Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/millskyle/extensive_deep_neural_networks). The program  collects all the samples into one hdf5 file and computes the image of the graphene from an array of points with a potential well used in [this publication](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/SC/C8SC04578J#!divAbstract).

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three major sections:
- commonlib: some common classes for dealing with the porous dataset
- threaded: first attempt at optimal data processing with a reader thread and a processing thread
- cuda: parallelized processing

## Dependencies
- libhdf5-cpp
- Cuda
- CMake 3.0.0+
- Google Test

all included as CMake packages

## Setup
to set up cmake, do

    mkdir build
    cmake -B build
then build from makefile or `.sln`

## Use
Currently, the program does not take in any command line arguments, with unit tests that produce output based on a small number of sample files. These are outputted in the root directory of the project.

Use 

    python test-view.py <filename>.hdf5 <index>
to plot the image produced at some index
